        The box-sizing property is a CSS property that allows you to control the
        size of an element's content box, padding box, or border box. It can be
        used to create an alternate box model, which is useful for certain
        layout scenarios. By default, the size of an element's content box is
        determined by the size of its content, while the size of the padding and
        border is determined by the values of the padding and border properties.
        This is known as the "content-box" model. However, you can use the
        box-sizing property to switch to the "border-box" model, in which the
        size of the element's content box is determined by the size of the
        element itself, and the padding and border are included within the
        element's dimensions. This can be useful for creating flexible layouts,
        as it allows you to set the size of an element using a fixed width and
        height, and then add padding and borders without affecting the element's
        overall size.
